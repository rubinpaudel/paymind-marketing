              Informal Negotiations To expedite resolution and control the cost
              of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms
              (each a &#39;Dispute&#39; and collectively, the
              &#39;Disputes&#39;) brought by either you or us (individually, a
              &#39;Party&#39; and collectively, the &#39;Parties&#39;), the
              Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except
              those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least
              sixty (60) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal
              negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the
              other Party. Binding Arbitration Any dispute arising from the
              relationships between the Parties to these Legal Terms shall be
              determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in accordance with
              the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of
              Arbitration being part of the European Centre of Arbitration
              having its seat in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time
              the application for arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of
              this clause constitutes acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall
              be Bruges, Belgium. The language of the proceedings shall be
              Dutch. Applicable rules of substantive law shall be the law of
              Belgium. Restrictions The Parties agree that any arbitration shall
              be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the
              full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined
              with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for
              any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilise
              class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority
              for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
              capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
              Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration The Parties
              agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above
              provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration:
              (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
              validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party;
              (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft,
              piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorised use; and (c) any
              claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
              illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
              arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
              provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
              shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the
              courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to
              submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
